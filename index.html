    <h2>About Luca Newman</h2>
    <p class="biography">
      Luca Newman is a 14-year-old prodigy from a musical family. His father, a piano technician, introduced him to the piano at an early age, and Luca quickly developed his skills through both formal and informal learning. His father, although unable to read music, played the piano, and the two enjoyed making music together. At just under eight years old, Luca began his formal piano lessons and became fascinated by the patterns in music. He quickly started composing, and his love for classical music grew as he explored sheet music books his parents bought for him.
    </p>
    <p class="biography">
      Luca applied to the Purcell School of Music when he was ten and passed auditions for both the keyboard and composition departments. At the school’s open day, when he showed his composition notebooks to students, one remarked, "Are you Mozart?" because he could compose music purely by ear. In the following year, he was selected to compose an orchestral piece for the school orchestra, which was performed in March.
    </p>
    <p class="biography">
      Luca has participated in six international piano competitions, winning second prize twice and first place four times. Notably, he won the Piano Talents International Competition in Milan in June 2023. He also won 1st place in the Alicante Piano Competition in early 2024. His performances have included solo recitals, including one in Romania at age 12, which was broadcast on national radio. Luca also performed his first piano concerto (Mendelssohn's Piano Concerto No. 1, Opus 25) with a full orchestra in 2023.
